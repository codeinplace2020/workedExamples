				<h1>Birthday Probability
</h1>
				<p class="subtleHeading">Problem written by Mahlon
</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>
  When people get together, it's amazing what we have in common!
</p>
<p>
  Did you know that if 70 people are chosen at random, there's a 99.9% probability that at least two of them share a birthday? And in a random group of 23 people, there's a greater than 50% chance that two of them have the same birthday.
</p>
<p>
  Some people call it a paradox, but it's really just a surprising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">result of probability</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you have <i>n</i> people in a group, this is the equation to compute the probability that two or more of them share the same birthday:
</p>
<center>
  <img style="width:200px" src="./equation.png">
</center>
<p>
  Let's break down that mathematical notation.
</p>
<p>
  It might be easier to decompose this into smaller sub-problems. For example, you might compute the numerator first, then compute the denominator, then divide the numerator by the denominator. You can store each of these intermediate results in variables.
</p>
<p>
  The top part of the fraction, the numerator, means that if there are four people in the group and 365 days in the year, you would multiply <code>365 * 364 * 363</code>. If there are six people in the group, the numerator would be <code>365 * 364 * 363 * 362 * 361</code>. Note that the number of terms starting with 365 is <i>one less than the number of people</i>. The <code>*</code> operator is used to multiply numbers in Python.
</p>
<p>
  Since we don't know in advance how many people are in the group, your code will need to take the user's input as a string, convert it to an integer, and then perform the multiplications in the numerator <code>n - 1</code> times. This sequence is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a>. While there are Python functions to compute factorials, for this exercise you might consider a <code>for</code> loop instead.
</p>
<p>
  The denominator is the number of days in the year raised to the power of the number of people in the group. In Python, the <code>**</code> operator will do this. For example, if there are six people in the group, the denominator would be <code>365 ** 6</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The fraction by itself is the probability that there are <i>no people with the same birthday</i>. Since we want the probability that there are <i>some people with the same birthday</i> we subtract this amount from 1.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal is to write a program that asks the user for the number of people in a group and then displays the probability that at least two of them share the same birthday. To make the probability easier to read, show it as a percentage (multiply by 100), and only show at most two digits after the decimal (use the <code>round(number, 2)</code> function).
</p>
<p>
  We will assume that the user enters a number. However, if the user enters a number less than 2, that's not enough to be a group of people, so we should respond with an appropriate message. You might want to store the number of days in a year as a constant, so that if you want to run this in a leap year, it's easy to change in one place.

<pre class="console" style="width:640px">
  How many people are in the group? <span class="blue">0</span>
  You need at least 2 people to make a group!

  You need at least 2 people to make a group!

  How many people are in the group? <span class="blue">11</span>
  There is a 14.1% chance at least two people share the same birthday!

				<h2>Solution</h2>
				<pre class="console" id="editor" style="height:980.0px">&#039;&#039;&#039;
what is the probability that two people in a group share the same birthday?
prompt the user to enter the number of people in a group
compute the probability that at least two people in the group share the same birthday
&#039;&#039;&#039;

# constant: days in the year, change this to 366 for leap years
DAYS_IN_YEAR = 365

def main():
    # ask the user for the number of people in a group
    # the user should enter a number, but python will put it in a string-type variable
    people_in_group_str = input(&#039;How many people are in the group? &#039;)

    # convert the string-type variable to an integer
    people_in_group = int(people_in_group_str)
    
    # validate the user&#039;s input since it takes at least 2 people to make a group
    if people_in_group &lt; 2:
        print(&#039;You need at least two people to make a group!&#039;)
        return

    # compute the numerator of the probability equation
    prob_numerator = 1.0
    for i in range(people_in_group):
        prob_numerator = prob_numerator * (DAYS_IN_YEAR - i)
    
    # compute the denominator of the probability equation
    prob_denominator = 365 ** people_in_group

    # calculate the probability that nobody shares a birthday
    prob_nobody = prob_numerator / prob_denominator

    # calculate probability that at least two people share a birthday
    prob_somebody = 1 - prob_nobody

    # convert the probability to a percentage with at most two digits after the decimal
    prob_somebody_pct = round(prob_somebody * 100, 2)

    # convert the probability percentage to a string that we can display to the user
    prob_somebody_pct_str = str(prob_somebody_pct)

    # display the result to the user
    response = &#039;There is a &#039; + prob_somebody_pct_str + &#039;% chance &#039;
    response = response + &#039;at least two people share the same birthday!&#039;
    print(response)
