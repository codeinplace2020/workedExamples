In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of cognitive interference where a delay in the reaction time of a task occurs due to a mismatch
in stimuli. The corresponding paper is one of the most cited in the history of Psychology. In this section we are going to implement a working version
of a Stroop test. <br>
Our stroop test has two phases: <br>
The first phase is the “control phase”. The user is shown color names written in the same font-color. <br>
Each time the user has to write the name of the color. <br>
Count how many times they type the name of the color correctly in 10 seconds <br>
Here are a few examples: <br>
<p style="color :pink"> pink </p>
What color ink is the word written in? pink

<p style="color: red"> red </p>
What color ink is the word written in? red

<p style="color :blue"> blue </p>
What color ink is the word written in? green <br>
Correct answer was blue.
