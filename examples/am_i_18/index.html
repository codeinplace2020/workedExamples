    As we all know, there are age restrictions in all kinds of matters -- playing video games, casting votes, and even to register in
    Code in Place :').
    For the purpose of this problem, we are going to think about the age limit that is used most of the time -- 18 years, 
    which is the age for voting in most countries.

<p>
    Write a program that takes a person's age as input and determines if a person can vote or not, that is, if he is older than 18 years old or not.
</p>
<pre class="console" style="width:800px">
    Enter your age: 12
    Sorry, you can't vote yet!

</pre>
