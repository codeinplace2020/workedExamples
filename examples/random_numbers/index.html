Write a program in the file random_numbers.py that prints 10 random integers (each
random integer should have a value between 0 and 100, inclusive). Your program
should use a constant named NUM_RANDOM, which determines the number of random
numbers to print (with a value of 10). It should also use constants named MIN_RANDOM
and MAX_RANDOM to determine the minimal and maximal values of the random numbers
generated (with respective values 0 and 100). To generate random numbers, you should
use the function random.randint() from Pythonâ€™s random library. <br>
Example: <br>
35 <br>
10 <br>
45 <br>
59 <br>
45 <br>
100 <br>
8 <br>
31 <br>
48 <br>
6 <br>
It's alright if your code does not generate the exact numbers above.
