    Make
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Sierpinski
    Triangle</a> !  A Sierpinski triangle is a super cool shape.  It can
    be made by starting with an equilateral triangle, and splitting it
    into 4 equal smaller triangles, removing or coloring the middle of
    these smaller triangles, and then repeating the process on the
    remaining three triangles.  You keep doing this process forever!  In
    this program, you can stop after some number of levels, or until
    your triangles get too small.

<p> Write a program that produces a Sierpinski triangle.  Show your work
    by taking a screen capture of it, for example:</p>

    graphics for you, and demonstrates how to draw a triangle.</p>
